            <p class="words">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ReTrn, a composer, singer, and conductor, whose music is not to conform. His melodies swerved and soared, unbound by the usual rules. "Your music shouldn't be chained by expectations," he'd say.</p>
            <p class="words">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is a tapestry woven from your soul, a raw expression of what moves you. It's the first brushstroke on your canvas, the unfiltered whisper of your heart. No formula, no critic, can dictate its form.</p>
